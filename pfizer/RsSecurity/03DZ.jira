h3. Cons of Amazon DataZone

* *AWS Ecosystem Dependence*: Primarily designed for AWS-based data management, which may limit its flexibility in hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

* *Learning Curve for Non-Technical Users*: Despite business glossaries and metadata, non-technical users may face challenges when navigating complex governance and sharing policies.

* *Complex Setup and Management*: Setting up and managing fine-grained data governance policies, roles, and workflows can be difficult, particularly for large organizations.

* *No Multi-Region Data Sharing*: Lack of support for data sharing across multiple AWS regions limits its utility for global-scale operations.

* *Cost Considerations*: Running multiple AWS services like Glue, Redshift, and S3 in combination with DataZone can result in higher costs, particularly for large-scale environments.

* *Limited Customization for Third-Party Integrations*: While it supports third-party integrations, customization options are limited compared to other specialized data governance tools.

* *Relatively New Service*: Amazon DataZone is a new service with limited information and AWS support. Many features can already be achieved using existing Redshift mechanisms, which makes the added value of DataZone less clear for some organizations.
